        <h4>"... any difficulty I shared, I got a solution ..."</h4>
        <p><i>As an anxious mom I have been very confused and worried for my daughter's 
            future. Leesha nobel is one therapist where I found the answer. 
            With God's grace I came across Mona Mam and with any difficulty I shared, I got a solution. In very simple day 
            to day activities, how to get involved with the child and what activities will help for any kind of her issues. 
            Not only for my child but she has been a great support for me. The most important thing that I learned from her 
            was to have affirmation in myslef and in my child. Every month when I see the difference and progress in my child, 
            I know she is in the right hand.</i>
